Additionally, the rising focus on health and wellness is increasing the production of health supplements and vitamins, where food grade alcohol is often employed. Besides this, ongoing research operations in the pharmaceutical sector, aimed at launching new and more effective medicines, is further driving the demand for high-purity, food grade alcohol.
